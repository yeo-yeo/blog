`hugo` to build 

`hugo server` to run locally 

`hugo server -D` to include draft posts

My goal for this site was just to get the simplest (but not totally hideous) thing up and running quickly.  I did a minimal amount of research and settled on using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a [design template](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink), and hosting on Github Pages.
