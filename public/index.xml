      <description>LDN -&amp;gt; NYC The Recurse Center is based in New York and pre-Covid all attendance was in person at its office space, the &amp;lsquo;Hub&amp;rsquo;, in Brooklyn. Since the pandemic physical attendance has been optional, but given that a lot of the value of RC is the connections you make and the ideas you share, I wanted to attend in person. Circumstances meant I was still at home in London for week 1, but the big thing for me in week 2 was I arrived in New York.</description>

      <description>Wello, horld! Earlier this month I decided to leave my job and spend a few weeks at the Recurse Center, working on my programming skills and taking time to think about what I&amp;rsquo;d like to do next.&#xA;Participants aren&amp;rsquo;t required to write a blog about their time here, but it is a great way to document what you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing in this busy period, for your future self if nobody else.</description>
