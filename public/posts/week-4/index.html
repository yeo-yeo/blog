<p>Last week I got a lot of educational value out of motoring through Nand 2 Tetris Part 1, but at the end of the week I noticed that the intensity of working solo through it had left me feeling somewhat isolated.  Knowing too that working on a self-directed project can lead to bigger learning payoffs, as you learn to plot your own way through a fog of uncertainty without the guardrails of a curriculum, I decided to pivot to something else for a little bit.</p>
<p>I happened to have seen a visualisation of <a href="https://viewshed.matinic.us/2018/01/13/1139/">annual US snowfall</a> that tickled my brain and thought maybe I could do something similar.  The UK has experienced an increase in severe downpours in recent years, linked to climate change, and I thought it might be interesting to compare similar animations of rainfall across different time periods to communicate this.</p>
<p><a href="https://viewshed.matinic.us/2018/01/13/1139/"><img alt="the inspiration" src="/snow-animated-small.gif" width="400px" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this enough of a challenge?&rdquo; I wondered to myself, since the author of the snowfall work even documented their code to produce it, and I know that a plethora of powerful graphics libraries exist.  Why not just try and whip something together I thought, and then I can always look at extending it or move on to something else.</p>
<p>It turns that lack of challenge was not the issue; quite the reverse.  I was able to find <a href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/4dc8450d889a491ebb20e724debe2dfb">data</a> from the UK&rsquo;s Centre for Environmental Data Analysis easily enough, but reading it and turning it into something usable has turned out to be another matter.</p>
<p>The files are in a scientific data format called NetCDF.  The first thing I wanted to do was just open one and see what was inside.  Could I open it in a text editor?  No, it is in some sort of binary format.  Can I find a viewer to open the files?  The first one I try tells me the file is invalid.  Maybe because the format has existed since 1990 and there are different versions?  I manage to open it on another tool and feel a rush of excitement&hellip;. until I see this.</p>
<img src="/computer-says-no.png" alt="wtf" style="max-width: 600px">
<p>Is it possible that the UK&rsquo;s scientific agencies are actually just run by toddlers with a pack of biros, and noone has noticed until now?  Probably not (but I&rsquo;m not ruling it out).</p>
<p>At some point one fellow recurser pointed me to another, <a href="https://github.com/jake-low">Jake Low</a>, who has a lot of experience in visualisation and mapping.  We hopped on a quick call for me to explain what I was trying to do and he gave me some useful suggestions about things I&rsquo;d need to consider and some tools I might find handy.</p>
<p>Some blood, sweat, and tears later I manage to <strong>sort of</strong> get something working, but was stuck on three things:</p>
<p><img src="/uk-map.gif" alt="this but not this"></p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn&rsquo;t yet summing the data cumulatively across time and was running into trouble trying to do this</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t understand how the greyscale of the .tif files I was producing was being calculated - did it think that &gt;= 1mm of rain should correspond to a 100% white pixel?  If so, this is going to become a very boring animation very quickly</li>
<li>I had originally downloaded low resolution data because I thought it would be easier to handle smaller inputs, and then substitute the finer grained version once I had the process up and running - more on this below</li>
</ul>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t really got unstuck yet.  I&rsquo;ve been through what feels like a hundred iterations of different approaches, and whenever one thing starts working, something else falls apart.  The problem is that these data formats and tools are immensely complex and powerful, but I don&rsquo;t have the time (interest?) to sit down and really get to grips with everything.  The documentation for the main R package I&rsquo;ve ended up using runs to 250 pages, and yet every single piece I read seems to assume vast amounts of prior knowledge, and omit every detail that I want explained.  Different tools show different things when you peak at the data, and there is a lot of different teminology (is one time point of data a &rsquo;layer&rsquo;?  A &lsquo;band&rsquo;?  A &lsquo;dimension&rsquo;? Are these always equivalent or does it depend on the context?)</p>
<p>At some point around here I find myself feeling nostalgic for the simplicity of a JSON structure, and appreciative of the wild abundance of Javascript learning materials on the internet.  How do climate scientists get anything done?  I suppose they spend years learning the tools of their trade, and benefit from working with fellow experts.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, when I went back to download the high resolution data from CEDA&rsquo;s website I got a constant stream of HTTP 500 errors, and still do.  I tracked down their ftp server which they said the data could also be downloaded from and a set of credentials (easier said than done)&hellip; and then found a sea of folders and files with impenetrable acronyms for names, none of which resembled what I was looking for.  I set off an automated search looking for the keyword of the dataset I wanted.  Over half an hour later, nothing.</p>
<img alt="nothing to see here" src="/crying.gif" width=250 />
<p>So much for thinking this might be too easy ðŸ¥².</p>
<p>There comes a point where the value you are getting from the struggle is negligible and you are just slowly losing the will to live.  Is it best to power through and find a way to bring some form of output to fruition, or should you recognise a sunk cost fallacy and refocus your energy somewhere more productive?  I think I&rsquo;m not ready to fully write it off yet, but what I do need to do this week (and probably should have done earlier) is actively pair with someone else on this to get a fresh perspective. Even just articulating the problems you&rsquo;re encountering out loud has an uncanny ability to make you suddenly see the answer - hence the popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">&lsquo;rubber ducking&rsquo;</a>.  And luckily, I am surrounded by people from all kinds of backgrounds who are not only excellent engineers but kind and generous collaborators.</p>
<h2 id="rays-of-light-through-the-clouds">Rays of light through the clouds</h2>
<p>The week didn&rsquo;t only consist of my self esteem sapping away with every misconfigured .tif pixel.  I also launched into a Kubertnetes tutorial and enjoyed this week&rsquo;s Missing Semester of CS workshop in which we discussed Vim, its steep learning curve and why devotees love it so much.  When we managed to select a block of text in visual mode and rearrange lines by piping it as a range to the <code>sort</code> command we erupted into raucous cheers and the last sceptics were convinced.</p>

<p>Roll on week 5!</p>
